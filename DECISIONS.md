# Flightdeck Decision Log

Every significant decision made during the design and build of Flightdeck is recorded
here, including the reasoning and alternatives that were rejected. When a decision is
reversed, that reversal is recorded -- not deleted.

**This is a living document.** As implementation progresses, plans change. Every
pivot belongs here immediately -- before the code is written, not after. The entry
format is: what was planned, what changed, why, what was rejected. A codebase
without a matching DECISIONS.md is a codebase future contributors cannot trust.

New contributors: read this before asking "why is it done this way?"

---

## D001 -- Sensor pattern over proxy/gateway pattern

**Decision:** flightdeck-sensor runs in-process and reports out-of-band over HTTP.
It does not sit in the path of LLM traffic.

**Reasoning:** A proxy/gateway pattern (agentgateway, Helicone) routes all LLM traffic
through an intermediary. If the gateway goes down, the entire agent fleet loses access
to LLM providers simultaneously. The sensor pattern has no SPOF. If the control plane
goes down, agents fall back to their configured unavailability policy and LLM calls
are unaffected.

**Rejected alternative:** Proxy/gateway pattern.

---

## D002 -- NATS JetStream over RabbitMQ

**Decision:** NATS JetStream as the message queue between ingestion API and workers.

**Reasoning:** Kubernetes-native, smaller operational footprint than RabbitMQ,
at-least-once delivery, persistent streams. OpenFaaS uses the same pattern.
RabbitMQ adds operational complexity that makes the Helm chart harder to self-host.

**Rejected alternative:** RabbitMQ (used in AI Ranger -- works well but heavier).

---

## D003 -- Two-identity model: AGENT_FLAVOR + SESSION_ID

**Decision:** Every agent session has a persistent identity (AGENT_FLAVOR) and an
ephemeral identity (SESSION_ID).

**Reasoning:** AGENT_FLAVOR is what the agent is -- its role, its policy attachment
point, its place in the fleet view. SESSION_ID is one running instance. Policies
attach to flavors, not sessions. The fleet view shows flavors. The timeline shows
sessions. Mirrors Kubernetes Deployments (persistent) vs Pods (ephemeral).

---

## D004 -- Identity injected via env vars from Helm

**Decision:** AGENT_FLAVOR and AGENT_TYPE are environment variables injected by the
Helm chart. Developers do not set them in agent code.

**Reasoning:** Platform engineer controls identity centrally. A developer who forgets
gets AGENT_FLAVOR=unknown, which appears flagged in the fleet view. This is shadow
AI detection by default -- not an error condition.

---

## D005 -- Directive delivery via HTTP response envelope

**Decision:** Control plane directives are delivered in the HTTP response body of
normal event POST calls.

**Reasoning:** Agents already POST events on every LLM call. The response is free
bandwidth. Delivering directives via this channel requires no additional connection,
no WebSocket from the agent side, no polling. The kill switch fires on the next
natural LLM call checkpoint -- typically within seconds for active agents.

**Rejected alternatives:** Long polling, agent-side WebSocket, polling endpoint.

---

## D006 -- Five session states

**Decision:** Sessions have five states: active, idle, stale, closed, lost.

**Reasoning:** Simple active/inactive is not enough. An agent can be alive but not
making LLM calls (idle). An agent can stop reporting without closing cleanly (stale).
An agent can exit cleanly (closed) or be killed without warning (lost). These
distinctions matter for the dashboard -- stale is different from lost, both are
different from healthy idle.

---

## D007 -- Configurable unavailability policy: continue or halt

**Decision:** When the control plane is unreachable, each deployment is configured
with either `continue` (run ungoverned) or `halt` (block until restored).

**Reasoning:** Different organizations have different risk tolerances. A startup with
revenue-critical agents cannot halt on a control plane blip. A regulated enterprise
cannot tolerate ungoverned agents even briefly. Both are valid operational postures.

**Third option considered and rejected:** "Continue but alert." Requires notification
infrastructure not present in v1. Removed as an option.

---

## D008 -- Postgres only in v1, TimescaleDB in v2

**Decision:** v1 uses plain Postgres for both fleet state and event time series.
TimescaleDB is added in v2.

**Reasoning:** TimescaleDB is Postgres-compatible and adds time series optimization.
Adding it in v1 complicates the Helm chart with no real benefit at early scale.
Once event volume grows and analytics queries become slow, the migration is
straightforward since TimescaleDB uses the same wire protocol. Analytics page works
on plain Postgres -- just slower at very large scale.

---

## D009 -- Token counts only in v1, dollar conversion in v2

**Decision:** v1 tracks token counts precisely. Dollar costs are not calculated in v1.

**Reasoning:** Provider pricing changes without notice. No machine-readable pricing
API exists. A dollar figure from a stale table is less trustworthy than the raw token
count from the provider response. Organizations apply their own pricing manually in v1.
Configurable pricing tables per provider/model are planned for v2.

---

## D010 -- Monorepo

**Decision:** All Flightdeck components in one GitHub repository.

**Reasoning:** Sensor, ingestion, workers, query API, dashboard, plugin, and Helm
chart are tightly coupled on schema and API contracts. A monorepo makes it easier
for Claude Code to maintain context across components, run cross-component integration
tests, and keep documentation synchronized.

---

## D011 -- Docker Compose as primary getting-started path

**Decision:** Docker Compose for evaluation. Helm chart for production.

**Reasoning:** Hacker News readers and individual engineers will not deploy a Helm
chart to evaluate a tool. Docker Compose is the 10-minute path. The Helm chart is
for platform engineers deploying to production clusters. Both run the same services.

---

## D012 -- shadcn/ui over MUI, Ant Design, or Chakra

**Decision:** Dashboard uses shadcn/ui as the base component library.

**Reasoning:** shadcn/ui copies components into the project as owned TypeScript files.
No dependency conflicts, no breaking changes on upgrade. Full control for customization.
Built on Radix UI for accessibility. The visual output matches the aesthetic target
(Raycast, Linear, Vercel) in a way that Material Design or Ant Design does not.

**Hard rule:** MUI, Ant Design, and Chakra are never introduced into the codebase.

---

## D013 -- Custom timeline component

**Decision:** The primary timeline surface is a custom React component.
D3 is used for time scale calculations only. React owns the DOM entirely.

**Reasoning:** No existing library ships a real-time swim-lane agent timeline matching
Flightdeck's visual requirements. D3 DOM manipulation conflicts with React's rendering
model. D3 is limited to `d3-scale` and `d3-time` -- the math, not the rendering.

---

## D014 -- Two first-class themes: neon dark and clean light

**Decision:** Flightdeck ships two themes, both production-quality.

**Reasoning:** Neon dark is the signature theme -- visually striking, drives organic
sharing. Clean light exists for engineers in bright environments and stakeholder demos.
A half-finished light mode is worse than no light mode. Both themes required at all times.

---

## D015 -- flightdeck-sensor built on tokencap foundation

**Decision:** flightdeck-sensor inherits tokencap's token counting implementation.

**Reasoning:** tokencap already solves accurate token counting across Anthropic and
OpenAI including streaming, async clients, and framework interception. Rebuilding
from scratch wastes effort and introduces regressions. The sensor extends tokencap
with control plane connection, identity model, heartbeat, directive handling, and
session lifecycle.

---

## D016 -- Tests required on every task

**Decision:** Every Claude Code task that produces code must produce tests.
A task with no tests is not complete.

**Reasoning:** Tests written alongside code are more reliable and serve as
specification. The phase audit process depends on tests being present to verify
correctness. AI Ranger and tokencap both showed that after-the-fact tests drift.

---

## D017 -- Go for ingestion API and workers

**Decision:** Ingestion API and Go workers are written in Go.

**Reasoning:** The ingestion API is on the hot path of every agent event. Go's
concurrency model handles high-throughput HTTP and NATS consumption cleanly without
Python's GIL limitations. Workers process a high volume of events concurrently.
Go goroutines are the right tool.

---

## D018 -- Claude Code plugin follows agents-observe hook pattern

**Decision:** The Claude Code plugin uses the same hook mechanism as agents-observe.
It is a dumb pipe that reformats events and POSTs to the Flightdeck ingestion API.

**Reasoning:** agents-observe proved the Claude Code hook mechanism works reliably.
Rather than invent a new integration pattern, Flightdeck adopts the proven approach.
The plugin is intentionally simple -- all logic lives in the control plane.

---

## D019 -- Prompt capture is opt-in, off by default

**Decision:** Prompt content (messages, system prompt, tool definitions, response)
is never captured unless explicitly enabled via `capture_prompts=True` or
`FLIGHTDECK_CAPTURE_PROMPTS=true`. Default is always off.

**Reasoning:** Prompts often contain sensitive business context, PII, proprietary
instructions, or confidential data. A platform that captures this by default would
fail security reviews at every serious enterprise. Opt-in means the platform engineer
or developer makes an explicit, deliberate choice. The default path is always safe.

The README, Helm values.yaml, and CLAUDE.md all make this explicit. The hard rule
in CLAUDE.md: prompt content is never stored or logged when capture is off.

**Rejected alternative:** Capture by default, opt-out to disable. Rejected because
it puts the burden of protecting sensitive data on the user, which is the wrong
default for a platform handling production agent workloads.

---

## D020 -- Separate event_content table for prompt storage

**Decision:** Prompt content is stored in a separate `event_content` table, not
inline in the `events` table.

**Reasoning:** A single LLM call with a large context window (100k+ tokens) can
produce 50-200KB of JSON content. Storing this inline in the events table would
make the table extremely wide, degrade query performance for all event queries
(even those that don't need content), and complicate archival/deletion. The separate
table means:

- Event metadata queries are always fast regardless of capture settings
- Content can be archived, compressed, or deleted independently
- Content is fetched on demand via `GET /v1/events/:id/content`
- The events table schema is stable regardless of capture configuration

**Rejected alternative:** Inline JSONB column in events table. Rejected because of
performance and storage implications at scale.

---

## D021 -- Analytics page with flexible dimension switching

**Decision:** The analytics page provides default charts that answer the most
valuable questions immediately, but every chart has a group-by control that lets
the user switch dimensions without navigating away.

**Default charts rationale:**

- Token consumption over time grouped by flavor: flavor is the most actionable
  dimension for an engineering leader -- it maps to a team or workload, not a
  technical detail like model name
- Top N by token consumption: answers "where is my budget going" immediately
- Sessions per day by agent type: shows production vs developer usage ratio,
  a useful signal for governance
- Model distribution donut: enables cost optimization decisions (which models are
  being used, could we swap one for a cheaper model?)
- Policy events over time: an upward trend is a warning signal

**Available dimensions for any chart:** flavor, model, framework, host, agent_type, team.
Available metrics: tokens, sessions, latency_avg, policy_events.

A single `GET /v1/analytics` endpoint with query parameters powers all charts.
The frontend calls it with different `metric` and `group_by` parameters per chart.

**Rejected alternative:** Fixed charts with no dimension switching. Rejected because
different organizations have different fleet structures -- a company with 50 flavors
needs to group by team, not flavor. The flexible approach works for all org sizes.

---

## D022 -- Analytics page in Phase 4, TimescaleDB in Phase 5 (v2)

**Decision:** The analytics page ships in Phase 4 with plain Postgres queries.
TimescaleDB is migrated in Phase 5.

**Reasoning:** The analytics page is valuable immediately even with plain Postgres.
Time series GROUP BY queries on plain Postgres are fast enough for most orgs at
launch-scale (tens of thousands of events per day). Adding TimescaleDB as a Phase 4
dependency would block the analytics page on infrastructure work. When event volume
grows and queries slow down, the TimescaleDB migration is a drop-in swap. The
analytics page code does not change -- only the storage engine underneath.

---

## D024 -- Anthropic cache tokens included in input token total

**Decision:** `AnthropicProvider.extract_usage()` sums `cache_read_input_tokens`
and `cache_creation_input_tokens` into the input token total.

**Reasoning:** Cache tokens are real tokens consumed and billed by Anthropic.
Excluding them would cause the sensor to undercount actual usage for agents using
prompt caching, which would make token enforcement fire later than intended and
give the fleet dashboard inaccurate consumption numbers. The total must reflect
what the provider actually processed.

---

## D025 -- Windows SIGINT handler skipped

**Decision:** SIGINT handler registration is skipped on Windows
(`os.name == "nt"`). SIGTERM is still registered. atexit covers clean shutdown
on all platforms.

**Reasoning:** Python on Windows does not support SIGINT in signal handlers the
same way Unix does. Attempting to register it raises an error. The atexit handler
provides equivalent clean shutdown coverage on Windows. This is a platform
constraint, not a design choice.

---

## D023 -- Provider terminology preserved in prompt capture

**Decision:** Prompt content is stored and displayed using the provider's own
terminology. No normalization into a common schema.

**Reasoning:** Anthropic uses `system` as a separate parameter alongside `messages`.
OpenAI embeds the system instruction as a message with `role: "system"` inside the
`messages` array. Normalizing these into a common format would lose information (the
structural distinction matters for debugging) and require ongoing maintenance as
providers evolve their APIs. Preserving provider terminology means the developer sees
exactly what was sent -- no translation layer to reason about.

The `PromptViewer` component in the dashboard handles provider-specific rendering:
Anthropic shows system separately, OpenAI shows all messages in sequence.

---

## D026 -- NATS pull-based subscription

**Decision:** Consumer uses pull-based JetStream subscription (`PullSubscribe`
with `Fetch(1)`) rather than push-based.

**Reasoning:** Pull-based gives explicit backpressure control. Each worker
goroutine fetches one message at a time and only proceeds after ack/nack. This
is the standard JetStream pattern for durable consumers. Push-based subscriptions
can overwhelm slow consumers and require more complex flow control logic.

---

## D027 -- Directive lookup covers session and flavor scope in one query

**Decision:** `LookupPending` checks `session_id = X OR flavor = (SELECT flavor
FROM sessions WHERE session_id = X)` in a single query.

**Reasoning:** Both session-specific and fleet-wide directives must be picked up
on each sensor POST. A single query is more efficient and avoids a race condition
between two separate lookups where a directive could be inserted between the
session-scoped and flavor-scoped reads.

---

## D028 -- GuardedStream.__exit__ returns None

**Decision:** `GuardedStream.__exit__` returns `None` instead of `bool`.

**Reasoning:** mypy strict requires `Literal[False]` or `None` for `__exit__`
methods that never suppress exceptions. `None` is equivalent to `False` at
runtime and satisfies the type checker without requiring a cast or `Literal`
import.

---

## D029 -- Go 1.22 stdlib ServeMux over third-party router

**Decision:** Used Go 1.22 `net/http` ServeMux method routing syntax
(`mux.Handle("POST /v1/events", ...)`) instead of adding chi or gorilla/mux.

**Reasoning:** Stdlib routing is sufficient for the number of routes in each
service. Keeping dependencies minimal reduces the attack surface and simplifies
the Go module graph. Go 1.22 added method-aware routing to the standard library,
eliminating the primary reason third-party routers were previously needed.

---

## D030 -- StartReconciler delegated through Processor

**Decision:** `Processor` exposes `StartReconciler()` which delegates to
`SessionProcessor.StartReconciler()`. `main.go` only knows about `Processor`.

**Reasoning:** Keeps `main.go` decoupled from internal processor types. The
wiring stays clean without requiring the entry point to import internal
packages directly.

---

## D031 -- WebSocket exponential backoff over fixed 3s interval

**Decision:** `useWebSocket.ts` uses exponential backoff starting at 1s,
doubling each attempt, capped at 30s.

**Reasoning:** A fixed 3s reconnect interval causes a thundering herd if
many clients disconnect simultaneously (e.g. control plane restart).
Exponential backoff spreads reconnect load. The shorter initial interval
(1s vs 3s) also means faster recovery for transient blips.

---

## D032 -- Handler interfaces for testability (ingestion)

**Decision:** Introduced `TokenValidator`, `EventPublisher`, and
`DirectiveLookup` interfaces in ingestion handlers so handlers can accept
mocks in tests. Concrete implementations (`auth.Validator`, `nats.Publisher`,
`directive.Store`) implement these implicitly via Go duck typing. A
`directiveAdapter` in `cmd/main.go` bridges the `directive.Directive` to
`handlers.DirectiveResponse` type gap.

**Reasoning:** Go's interface-based dependency injection is the idiomatic
pattern for testable HTTP handlers. Without interfaces, handlers require
real NATS and Postgres connections to test.

---

## D033 -- Store Querier interface (api)

**Decision:** Introduced `store.Querier` interface so api handlers accept
either the real Postgres-backed store or a mock. `WrapStore()` is a
pass-through helper.

**Reasoning:** Same rationale as D032 -- idiomatic Go testability pattern.
Handlers should not depend on a concrete type.

---

## D034 -- Go version pinned to 1.26

**Decision:** All Go modules use `go 1.26` in go.mod. Dockerfiles use
`golang:1.26-alpine`. CI uses `go-version: "1.26"`. golangci-lint v2
installed via `go install` to match.

**Progression:** 1.22 (original ARCHITECTURE.md) → 1.24 (attempted
golangci-lint v1 compat) → 1.25 (go mod tidy auto-set on 1.26 toolchain)
→ 1.26 (final pin matching installed toolchain). The 1.24 attempt failed
because pgx v5.9.1 requires go >= 1.25. The 1.25 attempt failed because
golangci-lint v1.64.8 was built with Go 1.24 and rejected go 1.25 modules.
Pinning to 1.26 with golangci-lint v2 resolved all incompatibilities.

**Reasoning:** Using a fixed version matching the development toolchain
ensures `go mod tidy` doesn't drift the directive. All Dockerfiles,
go.mod files, CI, and docker-compose.dev.yml are updated.

---

## D035 -- init() local limit is WARN-only

**Decision:** The `limit`, `warn_at`, and `degrade_to` parameters accepted by
`init()` only ever fire warnings. They never block or degrade model calls.
Hard enforcement (BLOCK, DEGRADE) is exclusively a server-side policy concern
configured in the dashboard.

**Reasoning:** A developer setting a local limit in a script is expressing
intent and wanting visibility, not writing infrastructure policy. A silent
block that stops an agent mid-flight because of a local `init()` param would
be confusing and harmful. Platform engineers retain full control over hard
enforcement via server policy.

Most-restrictive-wins applies across local and server thresholds: if `init()`
warns at 80% of 50k and the server warns at 70% of 100k, both fire at their
respective thresholds. Neither suppresses the other.

---

## D036 -- policy_warn events carry a source field

**Decision:** `policy_warn` events include a `source` field with value
`"local"` (fired from `init()` limit) or `"server"` (fired from server-side
policy). Both are stored in the events table and shown in the dashboard
PolicyEventList with distinct labels.

**Reasoning:** Platform engineers need to distinguish between developers
self-imposing limits and agents breaching server-enforced budgets. Without
the source field both look identical in the dashboard.

---

## D037 -- Event posting moved off LLM call hot path

**Decision:** Introduced `EventQueue` in `transport/client.py`. The interceptor
calls `enqueue()` which puts the event on a `threading.Queue` and returns
immediately. A background daemon thread drains the queue and calls
`post_event()`. `Session.end()` calls `flush()` to drain remaining events
before exit.

**Reasoning:** The previous design called `post_event()` synchronously from
`interceptor/base.py._post_call()`, which is on the LLM call return path.
A slow or unreachable control plane could block the agent for up to 35 seconds
(3 retries × 10s timeout + backoff). This violated the sensor's core design
principle: never add meaningful latency to the agent's hot path.

---

## D038 -- Postgres NOTIFY listener auto-reconnects

**Decision:** `ListenNotify()` in `api/internal/ws/hub.go` wraps the listen
logic in a reconnection loop. On any error it waits 3 seconds and re-acquires
a connection + re-LISTENs. The loop exits cleanly on context cancellation.

**Reasoning:** The previous implementation returned on any error with no
reconnection. A transient Postgres connection drop permanently silenced the
real-time dashboard until the API process was restarted. The reconnection
loop ensures the dashboard recovers automatically.

---

## D039 -- SIGKILL phantom session state (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Medium. SIGKILL bypasses all handlers. Session never transitions
to closed. Worker reconciler marks it stale after 2min, lost after 10min.
Up to 12min of phantom "active" state.

**Mitigation:** SIGKILL is untrappable by design. The reconciler handles
this case. The staleness window should be documented in operator runbooks.

**Address in:** Phase 3 (operator documentation).
**Code location:** `sensor/flightdeck_sensor/core/session.py:_register_handlers`

**Resolved in:** Phase 3.
**Resolution:** Documented staleness window. No code fix possible -- SIGKILL is
untrappable by design. Sessions affected by SIGKILL transition to stale after 2
minutes and lost after 10 minutes via the background reconciler.

---

## D040 -- PolicyCache empty on first call (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Medium. PolicyCache is empty until the first directive arrives
in a response envelope. First LLM call always runs ungoverned.

**Mitigation:** Add a preflight `GET /v1/policy` call during `init()` to
populate the cache before the first call.

**Address in:** Phase 2.
**Code location:** `sensor/flightdeck_sensor/core/session.py:Session.start`

**Resolved in:** Phase 2.
**Resolution:** Added preflight GET /v1/policy call in Session.start() before
returning. PolicyCache is populated before the first LLM call.

---

## D041 -- NATS event loss on unavailability (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Medium. If NATS is temporarily down, `Publish()` returns an error.
The sensor retries 3 times then drops the event (continue policy).

**Mitigation:** Add a local WAL/buffer that stores events when NATS is
down and replays them on reconnect.

**Address in:** Phase 2.
**Code location:** `ingestion/internal/nats/publisher.go:Publish`

---

## D042 -- No session state transition guards (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Medium. A replayed event could resurrect a lost or closed session.
No guard against impossible state transitions.

**Mitigation:** Reject events for sessions in terminal states (`closed`,
`lost`). Check current state before any upsert.

**Address in:** Phase 2.
**Code location:** `workers/internal/processor/session.go:HandleSessionStart`

**Resolved in:** Phase 2.
**Resolution:** Added isTerminal() helper in workers/internal/processor/session.go.
All handler methods reject events for closed and lost sessions.

---

## D043 -- Per-event policy Postgres query (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Medium. Policy evaluation runs a Postgres query on every
`post_call` event. At 100 events/second, that is 100 queries/second.

**Mitigation:** Cache policy in worker memory, refresh only on
`policy_update` directive. Avoid per-event database queries.

**Address in:** Phase 2.
**Code location:** `workers/internal/processor/policy.go:Evaluate`

**Resolved in:** Phase 2.
**Resolution:** PolicyEvaluator now uses an in-memory cache keyed by scope.
Postgres is queried only on cache miss or TTL expiry (5 minutes). Cache is
invalidated on policy_update directive.

---

## D044 -- WebSocket broadcast fan-out (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Medium. Every NOTIFY broadcasts to all connected dashboard clients
regardless of what they are viewing. At 500 users × 10k events/min this
is 5M messages/min.

**Mitigation:** Clients subscribe to specific flavors. Only broadcast
relevant updates per client.

**Address in:** Phase 2.
**Code location:** `api/internal/ws/hub.go:Broadcast`

---

## D045 -- GET /v1/fleet no pagination (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Medium. `GET /v1/fleet` loads all non-lost sessions into memory.
No pagination. At 100k sessions this is a large response and a full table scan.

**Mitigation:** Add pagination (`?limit=100&offset=0`) and composite index
on `(state, flavor)`.

**Address in:** Phase 2.
**Code location:** `api/internal/handlers/fleet.go:FleetHandler`

**Resolved in:** Phase 3.
**Resolution:** Added limit/offset pagination to GET /v1/fleet. `total_session_count`
added to top-level response. Default limit=50, max=200.

---

## D046 -- SHA256 token auth without salt (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Low. If the `api_tokens` table is leaked, short tokens (like
`tok_dev`) can be brute-forced. SHA256 without salt provides no key
stretching.

**Mitigation:** Use bcrypt or argon2 for production tokens. SHA256 is
acceptable for the dev seed token only.

**Address in:** Phase 5 (production hardening).
**Code location:** `ingestion/internal/auth/token.go:Validate`

---

## D047 -- No NATS auth in dev compose (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Low. NATS has no authentication in the dev Docker Compose. Any
process on the Docker network can publish to the FLIGHTDECK stream.

**Mitigation:** Add NATS token auth or NKey in the Helm chart and
`docker-compose.prod.yml`. Dev compose is acceptable without auth.

**Address in:** Phase 5 (production hardening).
**Code location:** `docker/docker-compose.yml:nats`

---

## D048 -- Token validation and rate limiting not cached (accepted trade-off)

**Decision:** Accepted as known trade-off for Phase 1.

**Risk:** Low. Token validation hits Postgres on every request with no caching.
No rate limiting on the ingestion API.

**Mitigation:** Add in-memory LRU cache with 60s TTL for token validation.
Add per-token rate limiting middleware.

**Address in:** Phase 2.
**Code locations:** `ingestion/internal/auth/token.go:Validate`,
`ingestion/internal/handlers/events.go:EventsHandler`

---

## D049 -- Directive lookup added to heartbeat handler

**Decision:** `HeartbeatHandler` now accepts `DirectiveLookup` and returns a
directive envelope in its response, identical to the events handler pattern.
This ensures idle agents (heartbeat only, no LLM calls) receive kill switch
directives within one heartbeat interval (30s worst case).

**Reasoning:** Without this fix, an idle agent with no LLM calls would never
receive a kill switch directive, making the kill switch useless for any agent
in idle state. The heartbeat is the only regular communication from an idle
agent to the control plane.

---

## D050 -- swaggo/swag for OpenAPI documentation

**Decision:** Use swaggo/swag to generate OpenAPI 3.0 documentation from
structured Go comments on handlers. Swagger UI served at `/docs` on both
ingestion API (port 8080) and query API (port 8081). Accessible via nginx
at `/ingest/docs` and `/api/docs`.

**Reasoning:** Machine-readable API docs are a requirement for any platform
tool used by engineering teams. swaggo/swag is the most widely adopted Go
OpenAPI generation tool, requires no runtime dependency, and integrates
cleanly with stdlib ServeMux. The spec is generated at build time and
committed to the repo so it is always in sync with the code.

**Rejected alternative:** Hand-written OpenAPI YAML. Rejected because
hand-written specs drift from code.

---

## D051 -- Smoke test deferred to Phase 5

**Decision:** The end-to-end smoke test will be written after Phase 5 closes
when all product features exist.

**Reasoning:** A smoke test for a platform is only meaningful when the platform
is feature-complete. Writing it incrementally per phase creates maintenance
overhead and tests a hollow product. The script will be written once and cover
the full workflow: instrument an agent, observe in fleet, set policy, enforce,
kill switch, prompt capture, analytics. Inspired by tokencap's smoke_test.py
pattern but adapted for a platform product rather than a standalone library.

**Address in:** Phase 5.

---

## D052 -- Policies table renamed to token_policies

**Decision:** The `policies` table is renamed to `token_policies` in all SQL,
Go store queries, and schema documentation.

**Reasoning:** The name `policies` is too generic. As Flightdeck grows, other
policy types (access policies, routing policies) may be added. `token_policies`
makes the purpose explicit and avoids future naming collisions. API endpoint
paths (`/v1/policies`) remain unchanged -- they refer to the resource name, not
the table name.

---

## D053 -- Delete confirmation uses Dialog not AlertDialog

**Decision:** PolicyTable delete confirmation uses the existing shadcn/ui Dialog
component rather than AlertDialog from `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog`.

**Reasoning:** AlertDialog would require adding a new package dependency. The
existing Dialog achieves the same UX without new dependencies. Constraint 4
(no new UI libraries) applies.

---

## D054 -- Nav bar added to App.tsx

**Decision:** A minimal 40px nav bar with Fleet and Policies links was added to
App.tsx. Fleet.tsx was updated from `h-screen` to `h-full` to accommodate the
nav bar height.

**Reasoning:** The Policies page required navigation between dashboard pages.
A minimal top nav is the simplest solution that works with the existing routing
structure. ARCHITECTURE.md App.tsx description updated to reflect this.

---

## D055 -- Self-contained CI coverage gates

**Decision:** Coverage enforced via per-component thresholds in CI with no
external service. Coverage HTML reports uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts
per run (14 day retention). No Codecov or external coverage service.

Thresholds:
- Sensor: 70% hard fail (baseline 71.7%)
- Ingestion: 60% hard fail (baseline 61.9%)
- API: 40% hard fail (baseline 41.4%)
- Workers: report only, no threshold (baseline 9.7%)

**Reasoning:** External coverage services add operational dependencies and
require secret management. Self-contained thresholds give the same CI gate
with zero external dependencies.

Thresholds are set just below current coverage as regression floors, not
aspirational targets. API and ingestion thresholds are low because the store
layer is SQL-heavy and meaningful coverage comes from integration tests, not
unit tests. Thresholds will be raised in Phase 4 and Phase 5 as new handlers
are added and coverage improves organically. Writing unit tests solely to hit
a coverage number produces coverage theater -- tests that execute lines without
asserting behavior, which is worse than no tests.

Workers threshold omitted -- unit coverage is structurally low (9.7%) because
SQL paths only run in integration tests. Integration tests cover what unit
tests cannot.

**Rejected:** 100% target -- forces trivial tests that mock away all
interesting behavior.
**Rejected:** Codecov -- external dependency, requires secret management.

## D056 -- golang-migrate for schema migrations

**Decision:** Use golang-migrate to manage all schema changes via versioned SQL
files in `docker/postgres/migrations/`. Workers run migrations on startup before
processing events. `init.sql` is reduced to seed data only.

**Reasoning:** The previous `init.sql` approach cannot apply schema changes to
existing deployments without destroying data. Every new column required
`make dev-reset`. golang-migrate provides versioned, reversible migrations that
can be applied to running deployments safely.

**Rejected:** ORM-based migration tools (GORM, sqlboiler). Rejected because the
project uses raw pgx SQL (D034) and ORM tools require ORM model definitions.
golang-migrate works with plain SQL files and is ORM-agnostic.

## D057 -- Heartbeat removed from sensor

**Decision:** The sensor no longer sends periodic heartbeat POSTs to the
ingestion API.

**Reasoning:** The heartbeat served two purposes: (1) updating last_seen_at for
stale session detection -- already handled by post_call events for active agents;
the reconciler correctly marks truly idle agents as stale after 2 minutes which
is the right behavior. (2) delivering directives to idle agents -- this use case
is not supported. Directives are delivered on the next LLM call. Platform
engineers are informed of this via the kill switch confirmation dialog.

The heartbeat added a background thread, polling loop, extra HTTP load, and
teardown complexity for no justified benefit.

The `POST /v1/heartbeat` ingestion endpoint remains to avoid breaking changes
but the sensor no longer calls it.

## D058 -- shutdown_flavor fans out to per-session directives

**Decision:** When `POST /v1/directives` receives `action=shutdown_flavor`, the
handler immediately queries all active and idle sessions of that flavor and
inserts one directive per session.

**Reasoning:** The `LookupPending` query in ingestion atomically marks a directive
as delivered on first pickup. A single flavor-scoped directive would be delivered
to only the first session to make an LLM call after issuance. Fan-out at creation
time ensures every active session receives exactly one directive regardless of
which session calls the ingestion API first.
