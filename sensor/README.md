# flightdeck-sensor

In-process agent observability sensor for [Flightdeck](https://github.com/flightdeckhq/flightdeck).

## Optional `session_id` hint (D094)

By default `init()` auto-generates a fresh UUID every time the process
starts. Orchestrators that re-run the same logical workflow (Temporal,
Airflow, cron) can instead pass a stable identifier; if the backend
already has a row for that session, the new execution is attached to it
and appears as a continuation of the prior run in the fleet view.

Supply the hint via either the `session_id=` kwarg or the
`FLIGHTDECK_SESSION_ID` environment variable. The env var takes
precedence.

### Temporal workflow example

```python
import flightdeck_sensor as fd
from temporalio import workflow

@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, input):
        ctx = workflow.info()
        fd.init(
            server="http://flightdeck.internal/ingest",
            token="ftd_...",
            session_id=ctx.workflow_id,
        )
        # If this workflow_id has run before, the backend attaches
        # this execution to the existing session automatically; the
        # sensor logs INFO on the first response that confirms it.
        ...
```

The sensor logs a single WARNING at `init()` time whenever a custom
`session_id` is in play so the behaviour is visible in operational
logs, and an INFO line on the first response where the backend
confirms attachment. See DECISIONS.md D094 and ARCHITECTURE.md
("Session attachment flow") for the full protocol.
